# Documentation for Algorithms in C#

Welcome to the **documentation** folder of the Algorithms project. This folder contains detailed information on the algorithms implemented in this repository, including their descriptions, time complexities, use cases, and implementation notes.

## Structure of the Documentation

The documentation is organized by algorithm category. Each file corresponds to a specific category and contains comprehensive details on the algorithms within that category.

### Files and Descriptions

- **GraphAlgorithms.md**:
    - Contains an overview of graph algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford, and more. You'll find a description of how each algorithm works, its time complexity, and example scenarios where it's commonly used.

- **DynamicProgramming.md**:
    - Explains key dynamic programming algorithms, including the Knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence, and Sequence Alignment. It covers bottom-up and top-down approaches and compares their efficiency.

- **GreedyAlgorithms.md**:
    - Provides information on greedy algorithms like Huffman coding and scheduling problems. This file explains the greedy choice property and offers examples where these algorithms are applied.

- **TreeAlgorithms.md**:
    - Focuses on algorithms that deal with tree structures, including Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms) and Optimal Binary Search Trees.

## How to Use This Documentation

Each file contains:
1. **Algorithm Overview**: High-level explanation of the algorithm.
2. **Time Complexity**: Analysis of the algorithm’s time complexity (best, average, and worst cases).
3. **Use Cases**: Practical examples of where the algorithm can be applied.
4. **Implementation Notes**: Tips and guidance on implementing the algorithm efficiently in C#.
5. **Testing Considerations**: Suggestions on how to test the algorithm, with references to corresponding test cases in the `/tests` directory.

## Recommended Reading Order

If you're new to algorithms, we recommend the following reading order:
1. Start with **GraphAlgorithms.md** to understand the foundational graph traversal techniques.
2. Move to **TreeAlgorithms.md** to grasp more complex data structures and their algorithms.
3. Dive into **DynamicProgramming.md** to learn about the powerful problem-solving technique of dynamic programming.
4. Finally, explore **GreedyAlgorithms.md** for algorithms that make locally optimal choices to solve complex problems.
